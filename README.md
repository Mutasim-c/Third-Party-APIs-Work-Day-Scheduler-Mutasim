## Challenge
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day

## Description
This website is a simple day calender that displays the working hours of the day (9-5) and alows a user to nput tasks they have to do in each hour of the cuurent day. The current day is displayed at the top of the page and each time block is colour coded to correspond to what hour of the day you are on, red being the current, green being future hours and grey being past hours. The inputs for each hour can be saved which will well save the data in the current timeblock so when the user uses the website again or refreshes the page the data persists.
